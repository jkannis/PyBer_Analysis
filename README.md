# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide insights about the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. 
### Goal
The goal of this analysis is to help the client improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved communities.

## Analysis
The results of this analysis show a large disparity between Urban, Suburban and Rural ride sharing services. 
### 2019 Rideshare Data
- The Urban city type had the most drivers, the most rides, and the lowest average fares of all city types. The data shows that there are more riders utilizing the service in urban areas, and the rides are likely for shorter distances as the average fares are the lowest of the three city types.
- The Suburban city type, on average, had fewer drivers and fewer numbers of rides per city than the Urban city type. The average fares for this city type were generally higher than the Urban city type, which is likely caused by locations being further apart in this type of area.
- The Rural cities in this dataset had considerably fewer drivers and rides per city, as well as higer average fares in general. It is logical that average fares would be higher as this city type would have the most distance between locations.
### Results
- All ride sharing data on one plot highlights the differences clearly

## Summary

It is clear that the highest usage of ride sharing services is in urban areas.

### Business Recommendations
1. Formulate a solution to the higher cost of utilizing ride sharing services in rural areas
2. Provide incentives for drivers in rural and suburban areas to make ride sharing services readily available
3. Create an advertising campaign in rural areas to increase usage of the service
